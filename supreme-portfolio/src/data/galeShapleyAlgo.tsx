      When it comes to matters of the heart, even algorithms can have their say!
      I took on the challenge of implementing the Gale-Shapley algorithm, a
      digital matchmaker that aims to solve the Stable Matching Problem.
      <br />
      <br />
      Pitting it against other algorithms in the love-finding business, I
      discovered just how powerful a few lines of code can be in finding the
      perfect pairings. Ready to take a peek into the realm of computational
      Cupids? Check out my implementation right {''}
